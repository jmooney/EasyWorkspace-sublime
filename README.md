Git Integration
---------------

    For explicit examples on integrating git with EasyWorkspace, see 'easy-ws-git-integration.sh'
    included in this repository's root directory.

Have you ever been knee-deep in adding a new feature to your git-versioned project
when suddenly a critical bug pops up? You save your current changes in your feature
branch, then start a new branch to tackle the bug. Git is happy, but what about
sublime!? All your open files/folders are just clutter while you work to fix
the new bug.

Wouldn't it be great if you could save your sublime workspace for your feature branch
and restore it when you come back to work on it? Well, with EasyWorkspace, you can!

EasyWorkspace commands are runnable from the command line. This allows one to easily
integrate EasyWorkspace with the shell and/or git to automatically manage workspaces.

For instance, one can create git aliases to do the following:

1. Save the active sublime workspace as an EasyWorkspace file associated with
   the current or specified git repo and branch.

2. Automatically open the EasyWorkspace associated with either the current or a
   specified git branch

To see these examples in action, check out the easy-ws-git-integration.sh file
included in this repositories root directory. This file details and exemplifies
script functions and git aliases which perform the above actions!
